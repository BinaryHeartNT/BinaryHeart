# BinaryHeart
Hello! This is the github page for [binaryheart.org](https://www.binaryheart.org), an after-school nonprofit that repairs donated technology and re-donates those devices to low-income schools. For BH'ers who want to make contributions, 
show up to the 5th floor of the Winnetka campus on Thursday so we can add you to the repo.
