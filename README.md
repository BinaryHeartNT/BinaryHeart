# BinaryHeart
Hello! This is the github page for [binaryheart.org](https://www.binaryheart.org), an after-school club that repairs donated technology and re-donates those devices to low-income schools. This is the second version of the website, now coded in HTML and CSS.

See the original website at https://github.com/IsaacNoel/binaryheart.

## For BH'ers
If you want to contribute to the website, come to the 5th floor of the Winnetka campus on Thursdays and we'll get you started!

### You will need...
- A computer (but an iPad also works)
- A Github account
- A Replit account (you can sign in with a Github or Google account)

### Instructions for starting
1. Get added as a collaborator to the repo (ask one of the BH web dev leaders!).
2. Open [Replit](https://replit.com/) and login.
3. Click the "+ Create" button.
4. On the "Create a Repl" page, click "Import from Github."
5. For the Github URL, paste https://github.com/meganklu/binaryheart2.
At this point, you should see the HTML and CSS files. You can start coding!

### Viewing changes
To view changes, click the green "Run" button. You should see the website load in Webview. Click the box with an arrow pointing out of it to open the website in a new tab.

### Committing changes
1. On the vertical bar furthest to the left, click the branch icon. This will open the "Version control" page. 
2. Choose a branch or create a new branch. *Do not commit directly to the main branch.*
3. Note what you changed and click the "Commit All and Push" button.

### Merging changes to main
1. On the Github page, switch to your branch by clicking the dropdown menu.
2. Click the "Compare & Pull Request" button and open a pull request.
3. If in the pull request, it says "This branch has no conflicts with the base branch," click the green "merge pull request" button and confirm the merge.

### Pulling changes
To pull other people's changes, open the version control menu in Replit. If the branch is behind the main's commits, click the orange "pull" button.
